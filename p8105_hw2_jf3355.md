Problem 1

This problem uses the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, available as an Excel
file on the course website.

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows
with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in
read\_excel use reasonable variable names. omit rows that do not include
dumpster-specific data round the number of sports balls to the nearest
integer

``` r
Mr_Trash_Wheel_Data <- 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", 
             range = "A2:N535") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019. For each, omit rows
without precipitation data and add a variable for year. Next, combine
precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable (the
variable month.name is built into R and should be useful).

``` r
Precipitation_2018 <- 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 7, 
             range="A2:B14")%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(total) %>%
  add_column(Year = "2018") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  rename(total_precipitation = total)
```

``` r
Precipitation_2019 <- 
  read_excel("Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 6, 
             range="A2:B14")%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(total) %>%
  add_column(Year = "2019") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  rename(total_precipitation = total) 
```

``` r
new_2018_2019 <-
  bind_rows(Precipitation_2018, Precipitation_2019)%>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.
Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets,
and give examples of key variables. For available data, what was the
total precipitation in 2018? What was the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2019?

``` r
nrow(Mr_Trash_Wheel_Data)
```

    ## [1] 454

``` r
ncol(Mr_Trash_Wheel_Data)
```

    ## [1] 14

``` r
nrow(Precipitation_2018)
```

    ## [1] 12

``` r
ncol(Precipitation_2018)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
nrow(Precipitation_2019)
```

    ## [1] 12

``` r
ncol(Precipitation_2019)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
nrow(new_2018_2019)
```

    ## [1] 24

``` r
ncol(new_2018_2019)
```

    ## [1] 3

``` r
sum(pull(Precipitation_2018,total_precipitation))
```

    ## [1] 70.33

``` r
new_mr_trash_wheel <- filter(Mr_Trash_Wheel_Data, year == "2019")
median(pull(new_mr_trash_wheel,sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 9

For “Mr\_Trash\_Wheel\_Data” dataset includes : 454 rows and 14 columns
with 14 variables: dumpster, month, year, date, weight, volume,
plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles,
grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls and homes\_powered. For
“Precipitation\_2018” dataset includes : 12 rows and 3 columns with 3
variables: month, total\_precipitation, year. For “Precipitation\_2019”
dataset includes : 12 rows and 3 columns with 3 variables: month,
total\_precipitation, year. For “new\_2018\_2019” dataset includes : 24
rows and 3 columns with 3 variables: month, total\_precipitation, year.
The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 9.

Problem 2

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.

``` r
pols_month_new <- 
  read_csv("pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon,into = c("year","month","day"))%>%
  mutate(year= as.numeric(year), day= as.numeric(day))%>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)])%>%
  mutate(president = case_when(
    prez_gop >=1 ~ "gop",
    prez_dem ==1 ~ "dem"))%>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop,-day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_new <-
  read_csv("snp.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(date= lubridate::mdy(date))%>%
  separate(date,into = c("year","month","day"))%>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         month = as.numeric(month))%>%
  mutate(year= ifelse(year > 2015, year-100, year))%>%
  arrange(year,month)%>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)])%>%
  relocate(year,month,day,close)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
new_unemployment <-
  read_csv("unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  mutate(month= str_to_title(month))
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

``` r
snp_pols <-
  left_join(pols_month_new,snp_new,by = c("year","month"))
snp_pols_unemployment<-
  left_join(snp_pols,new_unemployment, by = c("year","month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

For “pols\_month\_new”, the dimension of data is 822, 9, the range of
years is 1947, 2015 and names of key variables are year, month,
gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president

For “snp\_new”, the dimension of data is 787, 4, the range of years is
1950, 2015 and names of key variables are year, month, day, close

For “new\_unemployment”, the dimension of data is 816, 3, the range of
years is 1948, 2015 and names of key variables are year, month,
unemployment

For “snp\_pols\_unemployment”, the dimension of data is 822, 12, the
range of years is 1947, 2015 and names of key variables are year, month,
gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president,
day, close, unemployment

Problem 3

This problem uses data from NYC Open data on the popularity of baby
names, and can be downloaded here.

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables changed over time; you’ll need to
address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem duplicated, and
these will need to be removed (hint: google something like “dplyr remove
duplicate rows” to get started).

``` r
new_popularity <-
  read_csv("Popular_Baby_Names.csv")%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(childs_first_name= str_to_upper(childs_first_name),
         gender= str_to_upper(gender),
         ethnicity = str_to_upper(ethnicity)) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, 
                            "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER",
                            "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC", 
                            "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC")) %>% 
  distinct()
```

    ## Rows: 37537 Columns: 6

    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (3): Gender, Ethnicity, Child's First Name
    ## dbl (3): Year of Birth, Count, Rank

    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar
table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

``` r
rank_popularity <-
  filter(new_popularity,childs_first_name == "OLIVIA", gender == "FEMALE") %>%
  select(year_of_birth,ethnicity,rank)
```

``` r
popular_name_male <-
  filter(new_popularity,gender == "MALE", rank == "1") %>%
  select(-gender,-count,-rank)
```

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).

``` r
new_plot <-
  select(new_popularity, year_of_birth,gender,ethnicity,childs_first_name,
         count, rank)%>%
  filter(year_of_birth == "2016", gender == "MALE", 
         ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC")
ggplot(new_plot, aes(x= rank,y=count))+geom_point(color="blue")
```
